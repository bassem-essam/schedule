2/4/2022 (first night in Ramadan)
12:24 AM --> 1:12 AM | 1:22 AM --> 3:05 AM
Made a hierarchical table.

5:14 PM --> 6:00 PM
Now lecture just fits into its time (by index from 1 to 6)
Decided on a way to store data in files
Script prepare.py is now here.

10:50 PM --> 2:20 AM
Copying and pasting from schedules to my files
Made some styling, added little test filters
(most of time copying pasting, trust me, it takes
a while). I think you could learn ocr or something
to automate this, but it mostly will take more time
than copy paste.

10/4 Sunday (Mid night)
1:12 AM --> 1:49 AM
Made style changes, finally added IS table in my data
Now all tables are complete (I hope they are correct).

1:49 AM --> 2:50 AM
Trying filtering with simple string first,
then fighting with state objects.
the fight didn't end yet.

13/4 Wed
3:12 AM --> 3:25 AM | 5:44 AM --> 6:04 AM
State object (filter) passed and gets updated successfully
5:14 AM -> 5:44 AM
Testing how to pass object and update it in a child

19/4 Tue
8:00 AM

25/4 Mon
2:30 AM --> 3:07 AM

11:15 PM --> 3:07 AM
tried using only TableRows and TableCells but it's also messed up
Fixed combining filters
changed who (to department and section), made subject and instructors unique.
Added Select menu.
opened facebook for some time in it


26/4 Tue
5:31 AM --> 7:00 AM
I don't remember but 
maybe I added an initial grid

27/4 Wed
1:04 AM --> 3:20 AM
Played with containers and grids
but finally solved the problem
where was no space between grid items
but rather the spacing is inside the grid
item so you only need to put a box 
inside the grid item

4/5 Wed
2:45 PM --> 3:00 PM | 3:15 PM --> 3:30 PM
renamed ListOfLectures to GridView and put it into 
a single file in folder components
started writing a pattern in sed and grep to extract 
Material UI Components

5/5 Thu
1:25 AM --> 3:28 AM
Made an object of courses to list of indices of 
lectures or sections
which makes it faster to filter

4:47 AM --> 5:02 AM
Improved TableHeading slots.

5:02 AM --> 7:28 AM
made object (dictionary) of departments
tried changing the chaining of filters (worked but not very satisfying)
tried adding multi select chip but gave errors.

6/5 Fri
7:15 PM --> 8:14 PM
made multi select

8/5 Sun
5:12 PM --> 5:30 PM | 7:05 PM --> 8:13 PM
10:45 PM --> 11:55 PM | 
4:10 AM --> 5:36 PM
Working on lecturing and indices


9/5 Mon
1:15 PM --> 3:39 PM
Trying to split lectures and sections side by side and connecting them 
but errors are playing hard.

5:41 PM --> 8:19 PM

9:32 PM -->

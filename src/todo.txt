Hierarchy:
App
    FilterBar
    ResultView
        Table
            Head
            Row
                Lecture (Column)
        Series
            Lecture

Table divides data into separate days
    each day takes its subjects only 
        and pass it to ScheduledLectures
            which does right placement
